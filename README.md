## WATiSpend

An Android app that allows UWaterloo students to see their meal-plan spending habits and full transaction history in a simplistic format. 

## Get the App

Install the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nathaniel.watispend) if you have an Android, or install the iOS sister app [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watispend/id1060370995).

## Logging In

From the login screen, type in your student ID and Watcard pin, and hit 'login'. If this is your first time signing in, it can take up to a minute for all your data to be collected from Waterloo servers. 

After you've logged in a first time, you can select 'auto-login' in the settings menu to be logged in automatically in the future.
